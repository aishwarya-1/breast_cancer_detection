# breast_cancer_detection

## Problem Statement:
We have built classification models for breast-cancer detection. We classify them as malignant or benign.

## Models:
1. KNN: K- nearest neighbours model implemented, with the the optimal value of K found out by plotting Error Rate against K.
2. Decision tree: Decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences.
3. PCA + SVM: PCA to reduce the dimension to 2, followed by implementing a linear SVM with SGD (using hinge loss) optimization function.

## Models and their Accuracy
1. KNN: 96.28%
2. Decision Trees: 90.30%
3. PCA + Linear SVM: 94.28%
